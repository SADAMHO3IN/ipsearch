ipsearch
========

IPSearch is a Java Swing GUI application, it looks up the IP against a local database for its Geo Location and the other way around. The core QQWry.dat database structure and codes are from LumaQQ. It is incomplete and won't be maintained any more. It's just a small project to test my core Java and Bash scripting skills back in 2004.
