ipsearch
========

IPSearch consists of a Java Swing GUI and a JSP/Servlet Struts web application, it looks up the IP against a local database for its Geo Location and the other way around. The core QQWry.dat database structure and codes are from LumaQQ. It is incomplete and NO LONGER maintained. It's just a small project to test my core Java and Bash scripting skills back in 2004.
